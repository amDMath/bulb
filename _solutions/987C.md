It is the middle of 2018 and Maria Stepanovna, who lives outside Krasnokamensk (a town in Zabaikalsky region), wants to rent three displays to highlight an important problem.

There are n displays placed along a road, and the i-th of them can display a text with font size si only. Maria Stepanovna wants to rent such three displays with indices i < j < k that the font size increases if you move along the road in a particular direction. Namely, the condition s<sub>i</sub> < s<sub>j</sub> < s<sub>k</sub> should be held.

The rent cost is for the i-th display is c<sub>i</sub>. Please determine the smallest cost Maria Stepanovna should pay.

*1. Think by choosing which element you will end up in minimum operations of finding the rest two.*

Solution
--------
Itâ€™s clear from the problem that the given array C or S cannot be sorted, as it can change the order of elements. Additionally, S<sub>i</sub> < S<sub>j</sub> < S<sub>k</sub> is a constraint.

We now have to figure how to choose 3 elements such that its cost is minimum and S<sub>i</sub> < S<sub>j</sub> < S<sub>k</sub>.

Since S<sub>i</sub>, S<sub>j</sub>, S<sub>k</sub> need not to be consecutive, there are lot of possibilities to pick 3 strictly increasing elements, which we can do by a very naive brute force solution. But this will be an inefficient approach considering the time limit.

But the same can be done in a time complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>) by thinking a bit different.

The basic idea is to pick an element S<sub>j</sub>. S<sub>j</sub> - because it makes our job easier. *Why?* Consider we are taking S<sub>i</sub> then there are lot of possibilities of finding S<sub>j</sub> and S<sub>k</sub>. Instead if we take S<sub>j</sub> then we know that there is just one element on its right and left. So after picking S<sub>j</sub>, find an element S<sub>i</sub> toward its left such that S<sub>i</sub> < S<sub>j</sub> and its cost C<sub>i</sub> is the minimum of all costs in the left part. Similarly we have to find S<sub>k</sub> such that S<sub>k</sub> > S<sub>j</sub> and its cost C<sub>k</sub> is the minimum of all costs in the right part.

Store sum of such C<sub>i</sub>, C<sub>j</sub>, C<sub>k</sub> and find minimum among all which is the answer.
